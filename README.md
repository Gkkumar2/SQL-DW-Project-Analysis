# SQL Data Analysis Project

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the **SQL Data Analysis Project**! This project is dedicated to **exploring, analyzing, and extracting insights** from a structured dataset using SQL. We will dive deep into **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, identifying key patterns, trends, and business insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing a dataset stored in SQL** to understand business performance and derive actionable insights. We will explore dimensions, measures, trends, ranking techniques, and performance segmentation to highlight trends and patterns.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL**
- **Understand dimensions and measures**
- **Identify key business insights through ranking and magnitude analysis**
- **Analyze trends over time**
- **Segment customers and products based on performance**
- **Provide clear documentation**

---

## 📂 Data Sources

We will be working with structured data stored in SQL, specifically from:

1. **Customer Data** - Demographics and transaction history.
2. **Sales Data** - Orders, revenue, and trends.
3. **Product Data** - Categories and pricing information.

## 🏗️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔍 Database Exploration

We start by understanding the structure of our database, including:

- **Number of tables and columns**
- **Schema definitions**
- **Key relationships between tables**

📌 *Database Schema Overview*

### 📊 Dimensions & Measures

- **Dimensions** represent categorical attributes (e.g., country, category, customer type).
- **Measures** represent numerical values (e.g., total sales, quantity sold).

### 📅 Date Exploration

Understanding the time-based data points in our dataset:

- **Earliest and latest records**
- **Time span of the dataset**
- **Identifying trends based on date aggregations**

## 📅 Time-Based Analysis

### 🔄 Changes Over Time

We analyze how key metrics evolve over time to identify:

- **Trends in sales performance**
- **Seasonality and periodic patterns**
- **Growth or decline in key metrics**

## 📈 Magnitude & Ranking Analysis

### 🔥 Magnitude Analysis

Breaking down key measures by dimensions to uncover high-performing categories:

- **Top-selling product categories**
- **Revenue distribution across customer segments**

📌 *Chart Placeholder: Total Revenue by Product Category*
📌 *Chart Placeholder: Customer Distribution by Region*

### 🏆 Ranking Analysis

Ranking entities based on performance metrics:

- **Top 5 best-selling products**
- **Top 10 highest revenue-generating customers**
- **Bottom 3 underperforming categories**

📌 *Chart Placeholder: Top 5 Products by Sales*
📌 *Chart Placeholder: Top 10 Customers by Revenue*
📌 *Chart Placeholder: Bottom 3 Product Categories by Sales*

## 🎯 Performance Segmentation

Segmenting data to identify key performance indicators:

- **Customer segmentation by total revenue**
- **Product segmentation by profitability**
- **Sales trends by region**
